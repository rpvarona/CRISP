<p >NOTE: CRISP code is constantly under development. Some features may not be fully functional.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
1. Code</h2>
<p >CRISP is a C++ program developed to simulate nuclear reactions in a realistic fashion using Monte Carlo method. It requires the ROOT framework from CERN to work (homepage: <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/">http://root.cern.ch/drupal/</a> - Class Index: <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/ClassIndex.html">http://root.cern.ch/root/html/ClassIndex.html</a>). The Open MPI - Message Passing Interface (<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">http://www.open-mpi.org/</a>) is also required for the compilation and execution of parallel computations in CRISP. The MathMore module of ROOT is a package enabled during configuration step (see ROOT installation tutorial on the homepage) that provides advanced numerical functionality but is dependent on the external library GSL (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/</a>). Special mathematical functions like Laguerre Polynomials and Bessel functions are included in GSL. <br  />
</p>
<p >The code was designed for Linux Operating System. An attempt to run the program in any other OS may result on incompatibilities.</p>
<p >Other possible issues may arise from some incompatibility between ROOT and the operating system. Up to now, CRISP has been tested on ubuntu linux 10.04 LTS with ROOT v5.30 and v5.32 and on ubuntu linux 12.04 LTS with ROOT v5.34. No issues regarding GSL and Open MPI have been found so far.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
1.1 Event Generator</h3>
<p >For each kind of reaction there is a event generator placed in the generators directory. Each generator is responsible for loading the possible interaction channels between projectile and target and the initial interaction itself. The list of current implemented generators is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>proton;</li>
<li>photon(monochromatic);</li>
<li>bremsstrahlung;</li>
<li>virtual photon for ultra-peripheral collisions (UNDER DEVELOPMENT);</li>
<li>hyperon;</li>
<li>deuteron (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)</li>
<li>ion-ion collision (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)</li>
</ul>
<p >Up to now it is possible to calculate ultra-peripheral collisions with quasi-real photons by means of photo-nuclear reactions since both ions colliding interact only by their electrogmanetic field. This field can be treated as a flux of virtual photons. The final observables and quantities must take into account a proper treatment of the flux of photons according the Weiszacker-Williams method of the virtual quanta (Jackson, Electrodynamics).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
1.2 Modular Structure</h3>
<p >Several modules inside CRISP code performs all steps of a reaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>cascade: necessary code for intra-nuclear cascade simulation (step one).</li>
<li>mcef: code for the evaporation-fission competition simulation (step two). Both fissioning nuclei and spallation parabolas can be obtained.</li>
<li>multimode_fission: code for the determination of the distribution of fragments from fission (step three). The Symmetric and three asymmetric modes are considered as possible channels for fission.</li>
<li>mcmm: the multifragmentation module is implemented but NOT YET tested. It concerns another possible step two which is a final point for the reaction.</li>
<li>Langevin: an alternative approach to the evaporation fission competition step.</li>
</ul>
<p >There are some others important folders in the CRISP code which are worth mentioning.</p>
<p >A directory named "scripts" keeps all necessary routines for the execution of all currently implemented steps of a reaction. The routines are separated in sub-directories according to the modular division of the program.</p>
<p >The "Minuit" directory keeps (also in a modular manner) routines for adjustment of parameters of the models used in CRISP. All routines use the Minuit or Minuit2 implementaions from ROOT. Some of them are yet under testing.</p>
<p >Collected experimental data are placed in the "exp_data" directory. Other important data such as tables of more fundamental information (particle table, binding energies, etc) are in the "data" directory.</p>
<p >The "helpers" folder contains some useful code for general use.</p>
<p >Each simulation module (cascade, mcef, etc) requires a specific input file. All of them must be placed in the "input" folder and have a specific extension associated to the simulation to be performed by CRISP. Some of these files are there as examples and specific instructions can be found inside each one.</p>
<p >All results from each simulation module are stored in root files (a compressed file created for use with the ROOT framework). All information about creation, reading and other manipulations of this kind of file can be found on the ROOT User's Guide. The results generated by CRISP are created in the "results" folder. The sub-directories are automatically created by CRISP. They are organized according to the simulation modules, generators, target nucleus and so on.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
2. Compilation and Execution</h2>
<p >The CRISP code must be compiled in order to generate the executable file that will perform a specific simulation. The "Makefile" is the file responsible for this task. It is placed in the root CRISP directory. The simulations regarding nuclear reactions are predefined inside the Makefile. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="d3/d63/classCascade.html">Cascade</a>: mcmc (serial) mcmc-mpi (MPI)</li>
<li>Evaporation-Fission Competition: mcef</li>
<li>Multimodal <a class="el" href="d8/d18/structFission.html">Fission</a>: multimodal-fission (serial) multimodal-fission-mpi (MPI)</li>
<li>Multimodal <a class="el" href="d8/d18/structFission.html">Fission</a> adjustment of the model by Minuit: multimodal-fission-minuit (serial) multimodal-fission-minuit-mpi (MPI)</li>
</ul>
<p >The compilation and execution of a CRISP executable must be done inside the top CRISP directory. The compilation in linux command line is performed like this: </p><pre class="fragment">$ make &lt;target&gt; (ex. make mcmc, make mcef...)
</pre><p> Lots of information...</p>
<p >Then you can execute the created executable file which has extension .exec. The address of the input file is mandatory. For example: </p><pre class="fragment">$ ./mcmc.exec input/example.crisp
</pre><p> For the MPI situation, here is an example: </p><pre class="fragment">$ make mcmc-mpi
$ mpirun -np &lt;number_of_processes&gt; ./mcmc-mpi.exec input/example.crisp
</pre><p> The &lt;number_of_processes&gt; argument means the number of cores (if in a computer) or the number of nodes (in a cluster). In a cluster the command for execution may vary but usually it is as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">$ mpirun -np &lt;number_of_processes&gt; -hostfile &lt;hostfile_name&gt; ./mcmc-mpi.exec input/example.crisp
</pre><p> The hostfile file must contain the name of the nodes in the cluster. An example of a hostfile accompanies the CRISP package under the name of host.file. </p>
